# WaterWise

WaterWise is an advanced platform for monitoring and analyzing water quality across streams, lakes, and rivers, with a focus on cross-referencing this data with industrial wastewater discharge trends. By integrating datasets on water quality and industrial discharge, the platform identifies areas where industrial activities may be degrading local water systems. This makes WaterWise an essential tool for researchers, environmental regulators, and communities striving to understand the long-term impacts of pollution.
